## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS - BEM based approach
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom SASS variables
- Media queries
- JavaScript to the slider
- Animations

### What I learned

Writing reusable js code with DRY principle, a lot more work in positioning elements and absolute positions.

### Continued development

After this done, i want to continue using js to do better solutions of the elements iteration.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - This helped me a lot to better use the JS to be more effective.
- [DRY principle](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet) - This helped me a lot to better understand the DRY principle usage.
