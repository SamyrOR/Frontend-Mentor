## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS - BEM based approach
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom SASS variables
- Mixins

### What I learned

This was a real big challenge, to match colors from design ant the card photo demanded some hours of research, and the for this i learned how to use `mix-blend-mode: multiply` property from scss, i tried several ways to do with the filter method but was unsuccessfully.

Learned to how to use `@use` sass new import syntax.

### Continued development

Keep the enforcement to create great page even better.
