## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS - BEM based approach
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom SASS variables
- Mixins
- Transitions and Animations

### What I learned

This challenge my focus was in doing a great card with a smooth and beautiful animation, i think that i archived it, learned and practice the use of `::active` selector at the button to give more feedback on click by the user.

### Continued development

Keep development of great transitions and animations making the page more iterable.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs Animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) - Great article that helped me to understand the bem approach with sass
