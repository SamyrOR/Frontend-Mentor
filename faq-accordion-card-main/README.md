## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS - BEM based approach
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom SASS variables
- Pseudo Selectors
- Animations

### What I learned

A lot of work of positioning the elements with pseudo selectors, making it responsive and the accordion work without JS, rotate, transition, the checked selector and animations, this one was a great experience.

### Continued development

After this done, i want to continue using BEM, mobile first , sass and rem unit, pseudo selectors to facilitate the workflow, and transitions, animations.

### Useful resources

- [W3S Animations](hhttps://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_animate.asp) - W3S school animations documentation have all necessary to understand animations workflow.
