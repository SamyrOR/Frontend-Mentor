## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS - BEM based approach
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pseudo Elements

### What I learned

Learn a lot of manipulating background position images, `rem` unit use, pseudo elements, BEM approach and `vw` and `vh` units.

### Continued development

After this done a i want to continue using BEM, mobile first , sass and rem unit into future projects.

### Useful resources

- [BEM with SASS](https://medium.com/@larymagal/organize-seu-css-com-smacss-bem-e-sass-7e8f50a41544) - This helped me for using the BEM approach with sass extension and finally implement it.
